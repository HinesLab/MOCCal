# MOCCal

MOCCal, or Multi-Omic CCS Calibrator, is a Python application for high-dimensional, multi-omic traveling-wave ion mobility mass spectrometry (TWIM-MS) data anlaysis. Functionality includes collision cross section (CCS) calibration, experimental data biomolecular class assignment, and experimental class-specific CCS calculations. Notably, MOCCal offers class assignment and CCS calculations without need for identifying the features first. 

For installation instructions, please see below.
For usage tutorials, data templates, and example data, please see the MOCCal folders.

## Instructions for running MOCCal (UserDT)

If you plan to use MOCCal with processed calibration data, you do not need to install Python or any of the packages required to run the code. To use this version of MOCCal, simply download the XXX zip file, extract all, and use the MOCCal executable file. The only requirement is that the MOCCal executable is in a location that also contains a folder titled “Output.”

## Instructions for running MOCCal (RawDT)

If you plan to use raw calibration files, you will need to install pnnl’s DEIMoS, version 1.3.2 (http://github.com/pnnl/deimos). After DEIMoS is set up, you can then run MOCCal_RawDT.py in the DEIMoS virtual environment.
